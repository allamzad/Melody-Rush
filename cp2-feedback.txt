In CP1 I felt that my HTML was more disorganized as well in terms of using the right tags and organization.


2. To what extent would you like feedback in CP 2 (e.g. thorough, particular areas of HTML/CSSPlease fill out the following and submit with your CP 2 submission (added to help us know what to focus on when grading):
